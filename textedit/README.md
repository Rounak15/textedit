# Text Edit 

![Alice-pig](/Users/vboykis/Desktop/python_packaging/textedit/textedit/img/alice_pig.jpg)

The mini text editor for people who want to focus on learning Python packaging. This text editor lets you: 

+ Count the number of words, sentences, and characters in  each file 
+ Determine the [Colman-Liau readabilty index](https://readable.io/content/the-coleman-liau-index/)
+ Replace a phrase or string with another phrase 
+ Change spacing between sentences from single space period to double space/period

and not much else.

3. `cd` to textedit and run `python setup.py install`
4. run `pip -r requirements.txt`
5. That's it! You're ready to use textedit. 
6. If you encounter any issues, `export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/my/other/path"` to your `~/.bashrc` or Windows equivalent file.
